LuaSdk BETA README
========
1. Overview:
----
The PlayFab LuaSdk includes the files needed to make PlayFab HTTPS API calls within a Lua Project.

Current supported platforms are LuaDist console for Windows, and Defold.  Other Lua platforms are coming soon.


2. Prerequisites:
----
* Users should be very familiar with the topics covered in our [getting started guide](https://playfab.com/docs/getting-started-with-playfab/).

To connect to the PlayFab service, your machine must be running TLS v1.2 or better.
* For Windows, this means Windows 7 and above
* [Official Microsoft Documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380516%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
* [Support for SSL/TLS protocols on Windows](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaushal/archive/2011/10/02/support-for-ssl-tls-protocols-on-windows.aspx)

3. Contents:
----

* PlayFabClientSDK - All files neccessary to make API calls to the PlayFab Client API
 * This is the SDK you should include in your game, and distribute to your players
* PlayFabServerSdk - All files neccessary to make API calls to the PlayFab Server and Matchmaker API
 * This is the sdk you should optionally include in your live-server (if you have one)
 * For the security of your title, do not distribute any build which contains your devSecretKey
* PlayFabSdk - Contains all API methods
 * Generally for evaluation or debugging, and some special case live-servers
 * For the security of your title, do not distribute any build which contains your devSecretKey

4. LuaDist Example Instructions:
----

* Download PlayFab LuaSdk, copy PlayFabClientSDK/PlayFab into your project folder
 * Specifically, your PlayFabClientApi.lua file should be located: {YourLuaProjectFolder}/PlayFab/PlayFabClientApi.lua
* Add the following code in your main project (such as: {YourLuaProjectFolder}/main.lua)
```Lua
local json = require("PlayFab.json")
local PlayFabClientApi = require("PlayFab.PlayFabClientApi")
-- Always set your titleId first, before making any API calls
PlayFabClientApi.settings.titleId = nil -- TODO: Set this to your string titleId you created on PlayFab Game Manager website

-- After the above setup is complete, you can make a Login API call
local loginRequest = {
    -- https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Client/method/LoginWithCustomID
    CustomId = "TestCustomId",
    CreateAccount = true
}
PlayFabClientApi.LoginWithCustomID(loginRequest, function(result) print("Login Successful: " .. result.PlayFabId) end, function(error) print("Login Failed: " .. error.errorMessage) end)

-- After login, the full client API will fuction properly
-- PlayFabClientApi.GetTitleData( etc etc etc )
```

Alternately, from the console, you can run the playfab API tests by runing the following console command from windows (Lua.exe must be in your path environment variable):
```
lua PlayFabTesting/TestPlayFabConsole.lua
```


5. Defold Example Instructions:
----

* Download and install defold
* Set a project-dependency to our Defold Client Example
 * Details here: https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSdk/tree/master/Defold
* The following example script sets up PlayFab to a GUI element:
```Lua
local PlayFabApiTestSuite = require("PlayFabTesting.PlayFabApiTestSuite")
local PlayFabSettings = require("PlayFab.PlayFabSettings")
local IPlayFabHttps = require("PlayFab.IPlayFabHttps")
local PlayFabHttps_Defold = require("PlayFab.PlayFabHttps_Defold")

PlayFabSettings.titleId = "6195"
IPlayFabHttps.SetHttp(PlayFabHttps_Defold) -- The auto import magic doens't work if you set the name, so you have to set the reference

function init(self)
    local loginRequest = {
        -- https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Client/method/LoginWithCustomID
        CustomId = "TestCustomId",
        CreateAccount = true
    }
    PlayFabClientApi.LoginWithCustomID(loginRequest, function(result) print("Login Successful: " .. result.PlayFabId) end, function(error) print("Login Failed: " .. error.errorMessage) end)
end

-- After login, the full client API will fuction properly
-- PlayFabClientApi.GetTitleData( etc etc etc )
-- Try linking more api calls to buttons!
```
* Link the file to a gui script and run!
